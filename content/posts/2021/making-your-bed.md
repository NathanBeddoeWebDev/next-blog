title: Making your bed every day

At the risk of sounding like a certain Canadian psychologist, making my bed every day has improved my daily life on what, on the surface seems trivial, although diving deeper allows me to see the certainty it brings.

I live in a loft style townhouse, and can I tell you, the amount of relief it brings to come up those stairs and seeing a made bed has brought a smile to my face at least once.

So after approximately 12 years of my parents telling me to make my bed of a morning (yes, even after I left home), what actually inspired me to take action, and get into the habit of making my bed when I wake up in the morning, knowing that I was going to mess it up when I went to bed anyway?

I am a man of routine, although the habits that I've built are sparse and generally unhealthy. My house is dusty as I don't spring clean. In the past, my bed stunk of me because I didn't wash my sheets once a week, or even a fortnight, or even sometimes a month. Instead I indulge in habits such as overeating, watching netflix as soon as I get home, and not stopping watching netflix until I get tired and go to be at 9:30pm (my sleeping habits are probably my best habits. Thanks Mum and Dad).

So why is this habit of making my bed that I've just developed so important to me? For a couple of reasons:

- At age 22, it shows me that I can build new habits and I can add a few more wrinkles to this brain of mine.

- It adds a level of consistency to my life. I'm hopping into the same bed as I did last night. The sheets are arranged in the same way.

- It's simply neat and tidy, which in my own home, is something I've learned to strive for.

If I can pick up this habit so quickly... what else can I do better? What habits should I pursue in 2021? I've actually thought of a couple main habits I'd like to build in the coming 12 months, and I hope to write about these in the coming weeks.

- Healthy Eating
- Gym & Outdoor exercise
- Keeping my clothing organised
- Meditation
- Skin care routine
- Yoga
- Writing out my thoughs. Either in a public blog, or in a private journal.
- Practicing emotional intelligence

I don't believe I can build all of these habits in 2021, because it is hard, and a lot of these are life changing habits. I'll attempt to pick a few, and focus my energies on them in the next year.
